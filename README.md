Welcome to the Machine Learning Demos repository!

This repository includes practical machine learning examples ranging
from fundamental concepts to commonly used algorithms such as
classification, regression, clustering, and feature engineering.

Each example is designed to be simple and easy to follow, focusing on
core ideas rather than heavy abstractions. The code is suitable for
learning, experimentation, and as a reference for building larger ML
projects.
